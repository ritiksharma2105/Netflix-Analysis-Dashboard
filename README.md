**🎬 Netflix Data Analysis using Power BI**

**📌 Overview of the project:**

In this project, I analyzed a Netflix Dataset that contains Movies and TV shows along with their IMDb ratings and votes.
The aim was to explore the data, clean it, and build visual dashboards to understand patterns in ratings, runtime, and release trends.

This project was created as a part of my learning journey in data analytics and to get the hands-on practice with 
Power Bi.

**📊 Dataset Details:**

This dataset includes 5,000+ Netflix titles with information like:

- Title
- Release Year
- Runtime
- IMDb Rating
- IMDb Votes
- Age Certification
- Type (Movie or Show)
- Description

**Note-** A few more columns have missing values, which were handled during data cleaning.

**🔧 What I Worked on:**
- Cleaned and transformed data with Power Query
- Created a new metric using runtime to actual runtime in (minutes: seconds)
- Used slicers to filter by year, type, and runtime
- Build charts to compare ratings, votes, and trends

**📈 Key Observations**
- Titles with more votes usually have more reliable ratings
- Netflix content has grown heavily in recent years
- Movies show a wider variation in runtime and ratings
- Some age certifications dominate the platform

**🛠 Tools Used**
- Excel (Power Query)
- Power BI

**🚀 Key Learnings**
This project helped me to improve:

- Data cleaning skills
- When to use which chart
- Dashboard design in Power BI
- Finding insights from real datasets
